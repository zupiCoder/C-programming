# Beginner C-Programming Repository 🚀

Welcome to my beginner C-Programming repository! This is where I'll be storing all of my school files, projects, and experiments as I dive deep into the world of C programming.

## What's Inside? 📂

This repository is structured to help both me and you navigate through the various stages of learning C. Here's what you can expect to find:

- **`/basics`**: The fundamentals of C programming. From `Hello, World!` to data types and operators.
- **`/control-structures`**: Exploring `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, and `do-while`), and more.
- **`/functions`**: All about creating and using functions in C, including recursion.
- **`/data-structures`**: Implementations and examples of arrays, structs, linked lists, and more advanced data structures.
- **`/projects`**: Larger projects that integrate everything learned into comprehensive programs.

## Getting Started 🌟

If you're new here, start by setting up your C programming environment:

1. Install a C compiler: [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (Linux), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) (Mac), or [MinGW](http://mingw.org/) (Windows).
2. Choose an IDE or editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), or just a simple text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
3. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/zupiCoder/C-programming.git`
4. Start exploring and experimenting!
